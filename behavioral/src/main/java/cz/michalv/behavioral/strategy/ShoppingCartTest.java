/**
 * Strategy pattern is also known as Policy Pattern. We define multiple algorithms and let client application pass
 * the algorithm to be used as a parameter. One of the best example of strategy pattern is Collections.sort()
 * method that takes Comparator parameter. Based on the different implementations of Comparator interfaces,
 * the Objects are getting sorted in different ways.
 *
 * We could have used composition to create instance variable for strategies but we should avoid that as we want
 * the specific strategy to be applied for a particular task. Same is followed in Collections.sort() and Arrays.sort()
 * method that take comparator as argument.
 * Strategy Pattern is very similar to State Pattern. One of the difference is that Context contains state as instance
 * variable and there can be multiple tasks whose implementation can be dependent on the state whereas in strategy
 * pattern strategy is passed as argument to the method and context object doesnâ€™t have any variable to store it.
